# RanBALL: an Ensemble Random Projection-Based Model for Identifying B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Subtypes
**RanBALL** (an Ensemble **Ran**dom Projection-Based Model for Identifying **B**-Cell **A**cute **L**ymphoblastic **L**eukemia Subtypes), an accurate and cost-effective model for B-ALL subtype identification based on transcriptomic profiling only. **RanBALL** leverages random projection (RP) to construct an ensemble of dimension-reduced multi-class classifiers for B-ALL subtyping.
